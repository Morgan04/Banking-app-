# Banking-app-
This is a project I did 
The project is a little banking app, it is meant to solve and create a way for someone to save their money. 
The functions in the app I think are impressive.
I need to make it have a better GUI and to be able to save more information in it. I think I would want it to be like a capital one or bank of America app. 
I found doing almost everything difficult to do. I overcame this by paying more attention to how things work in C++. 
This project taught me how to use functions more professionally. I can transfer this information to python or java.
I added a lot of comments to the program to make it more understandable. I also made my code neat and readable for even a beginner to understand.
